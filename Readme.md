# Creating a Real-Time Chat App

## Download

Download the [Starter Code](https://github.com/DCSIL-summer-course/real-time-chat/archive/0.1.zip) and unzip it to a folder that is shared with your VM.

## Install 

From the VM, in the `real-time-chat` folder:

```
npm install  --no-bin-links

That will install the starter code's dependencies.
